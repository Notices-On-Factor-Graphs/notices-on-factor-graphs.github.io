**What are factor graphs?**
Factor graphs are graphical models that make the factorization structure of functions explicit, enabling efficient message passing-based inference and optimization algorithms in probabilistic models and beyond. Discover more about factor graphs in [Materials](./materials).

**How can I stay informed?**\\
Easy! Just sign up to our newsletter [here](https://forms.office.com/e/dRHED5wb0W).

**Presentation Themes & Topics**  
This colloquium brings together researchers from diverse labs and disciplines to explore the rich world of factor graphs, from their theoretical foundations to numerical methods and real-world applications. Presentations span topics such as probabilistic modeling, inference algorithms, and optimization techniques, often featuring insights from both internal teams and invited external experts. Whether you're interested in the mathematics behind graphical models or their use in robotics, signal processing, or AI, you'll find a stimulating mix of ideas and perspectives here. Find out about upcoming talks in the [Agenda](./agenda).
