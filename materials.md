# Quick Introduction to Factor Graphs

A Factor Graph is a type of bipartite graph used to represent the factorization of a function, typically a joint probability distribution. It consists of two types of nodes:

Variable nodes: Represent the variables in the system.
Factor nodes: Represent functions (or factors) that describe relationships among subsets of variables.

Edges connect factor nodes to the variable nodes they depend on. This structure makes factor graphs particularly useful in probabilistic modeling and inference because they provide a clear way to visualize and compute complex dependencies.

Key applications:

- Probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov random fields)
- Error-correcting codes (e.g., LDPC codes)
- Message-passing algorithms like Belief Propagation, which efficiently compute marginal distributions.

In short, factor graphs are a powerful tool for breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable components for analysis and computation.
